Subject: Free Online Tools Resource for [Their Site]

Hi [Name],

I noticed your article about [Topic] on [Their Site]. Great content!

I recently launched SinzTools (https://www.sinztools.app) - a collection of free, privacy-first online tools for images and PDFs. All tools run locally in the browser, so users' files never leave their device.

I thought it might be a useful resource to mention in your [article/resource page] as it helps [specific use case].

Would you be open to including it?

Thanks for your time!
