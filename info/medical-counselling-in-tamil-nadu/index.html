		<h1>Medical Counselling in Tamil Nadu</h1>
		<p>This guide explains medical counselling in Tamil Nadu, including available courses, eligibility, admissions
			process, and fee concepts.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to medical counselling</h2>
		<p>Medical counselling in Tamil Nadu is the process for admitting students to medical courses in government and
			private colleges. It is based on NEET scores and helps allocate seats for MBBS, BDS, and other medical
			programs.</p>

		<h2>Medical courses available in Tamil Nadu</h2>
		<p>Common medical courses include MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery), a five-and-a-half-year
			program. BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) is a five-year dental program. AYUSH courses like BAMS, BHMS, BUMS
			focus on alternative medicine. Allied medical courses include nursing and paramedical programs.</p>

		<h2>Basic eligibility for medical courses</h2>
		<p>Students need to pass Class 12 with Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. They must qualify NEET for MBBS and BDS.
			Minimum marks and age criteria apply as per Medical Council regulations.</p>

		<h2>How medical admissions generally work</h2>
		<p>Admissions are based on NEET scores through centralized counselling conducted by the Directorate of Medical
			Education. Students rank colleges based on their scores. The process allocates seats in government, private,
			and deemed universities.</p>

		<h2>How medical college fees vary</h2>
		<p>Government colleges have lower fees due to state funding. Private colleges charge higher fees. Fees can vary
			by course, with MBBS generally costing more than BDS. Hostel and other costs add to the total expenses.</p>
