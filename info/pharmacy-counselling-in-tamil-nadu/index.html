		<h1>Pharmacy Counselling in Tamil Nadu</h1>
		<p>This guide explains pharmacy counselling in Tamil Nadu, including available courses, eligibility, admissions
			process, and fee concepts.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to pharmacy counselling</h2>
		<p>Pharmacy counselling in Tamil Nadu is the process for admitting students to pharmacy courses in government
			and private colleges. It differs from medical and engineering counselling as it focuses on pharmaceutical
			education and healthcare roles.</p>

		<h2>Pharmacy courses available in Tamil Nadu</h2>
		<p>Common pharmacy courses include B.Pharm (Bachelor of Pharmacy), a four-year undergraduate program. Pharm.D
			(Doctor of Pharmacy) is a six-year program combining undergraduate and postgraduate studies. D.Pharm
			(Diploma in Pharmacy) is a two-year diploma course.</p>

		<h2>Basic eligibility for pharmacy courses</h2>
		<p>Students need to pass Class 12 with Physics and Chemistry as compulsory subjects. Mathematics or Biology can
			be the third subject depending on the course. Minimum marks may be required as per counselling rules.</p>

		<h2>How pharmacy admissions generally work</h2>
		<p>Admissions are merit-based through state counselling conducted by relevant authorities. Students apply based
			on their Class 12 marks. The process differs from NEET counselling as it focuses on pharmacy-specific
			courses rather than medical seats.</p>

		<h2>How pharmacy college fees vary</h2>
		<p>Government colleges have lower fees due to state funding. Private colleges charge higher fees. Fees can vary
			by course, with Pharm.D generally costing more than B.Pharm. Hostel and other costs add to the total
			expenses.</p>

			admissions. Check deadlines and required documents carefully.</p>
