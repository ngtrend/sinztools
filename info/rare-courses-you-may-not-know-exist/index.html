		<p>This guide explores genuinely rare and lesser-known courses in India that most students never hear about.
			These are niche options that can lead to specialized careers, but they require careful research.</p>

		<h2>What Makes a Course Truly Rare?</h2>
		<p>A course is truly rare when it's not just uncommon, but virtually unknown to most students and parents. These
			courses often get overlooked because counselling focuses on popular options like engineering or medicine.
			They exist in specialized universities but aren't marketed widely, making them hidden gems for students with
			specific interests.</p>

		<h2>Rare Science & Research Courses</h2>
		<p>These courses focus on advanced scientific fields that require deep specialization:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Geomatics / Geospatial Science</strong> - Studies mapping and spatial data analysis, offered at
				IITs and NITs.</li>
			<li><strong>Atmospheric & Climate Science</strong> - Focuses on weather patterns and climate change,
				available at select central universities.</li>
			<li><strong>Cryogenics</strong> - Deals with very low temperatures and applications, rare even among
				engineering institutes.</li>
			<li><strong>Oceanography</strong> - Studies oceans and marine environments, offered by coastal universities
				like Andhra University.</li>
			<li><strong>Radiological Physics</strong> - Combines physics with medical imaging, available at
				BARC-affiliated institutions.</li>
			<li><strong>Neurotechnology</strong> - Integrates neuroscience with technology, emerging in IITs and AIIMS.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These courses are rare because they require specialized labs and faculty, limiting them to research-oriented
			universities.</p>
