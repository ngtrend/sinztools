		<h1>B.E vs B.Tech – Complete Comparison for Indian Students</h1>
		<p>If you're choosing between B.E (Bachelor of Engineering) and B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology), you're not
			alone. Many students in India face this confusion. This guide explains the differences, similarities, and
			practical implications to help you decide.</p>

		<h2>What is B.E (Bachelor of Engineering)?</h2>
		<p>B.E stands for Bachelor of Engineering. It is a four-year undergraduate degree focused on engineering
			principles and applications. B.E programs emphasize theoretical knowledge combined with practical
			engineering skills. Universities like Anna University offer B.E degrees in various branches.</p>

		<h2>What is B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology)?</h2>
		<p>B.Tech stands for Bachelor of Technology. It is also a four-year undergraduate degree, similar to B.E, but
			with a stronger emphasis on technology and innovation. B.Tech programs are common in institutions like IITs
			and NITs, focusing on applied sciences and technological advancements.</p>

		<h2>Are B.E and B.Tech equal in India?</h2>
		<p>Yes, in India, B.E and B.Tech degrees are treated as equivalent by employers, universities, and government
			bodies. The difference is mainly historical and institutional. Both degrees qualify you for similar jobs,
			higher studies, and professional exams.</p>

		<h2>Which degree is better for placements?</h2>
		<p>Neither is inherently better for placements. Success depends on your college reputation, branch, skills, and
			performance rather than the degree name. Companies like TCS, Infosys, and engineering firms hire graduates
			from both B.E and B.Tech programs equally.</p>

		<h2>Which degree is better for government jobs and GATE?</h2>
		<p>Both B.E and B.Tech graduates are eligible for government jobs and GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in
			Engineering). GATE scores are used for M.Tech admissions and PSU jobs, and the degree type doesn't affect
			eligibility. What matters is your engineering knowledge and performance.</p>

		<h2>Does counselling (like TNEA) treat them differently?</h2>
		<p>Counselling processes like TNEA do not differentiate between B.E and B.Tech courses. They are treated
			similarly in terms of eligibility, cutoff marks, and seat allocation. The choice depends on the course name
			offered by the college. Learn more about <a href="/info/what-is-tnea-counselling">TNEA counselling</a>.</p>

		<h2>Which should YOU choose?</h2>
		<p>Choose based on the course content and college reputation rather than the degree name. Look at the syllabus,
			faculty, and placement records. If a college offers a B.Tech in Computer Science with strong industry
			connections, it might be better than a B.E from another institution. Consider your interests and career
			goals.</p>

		<h2>Common myths about B.E and B.Tech</h2>
		<p>Myth: B.Tech is more practical than B.E. Reality: Both include theory and practice; the difference is
			minimal. Myth: B.E is better for government jobs. Reality: Both are equal. Myth: IITs only offer B.Tech.
			Reality: IITs offer both, depending on the program.</p>

		<h2>Final verdict</h2>
		<p>B.E and B.Tech are essentially the same in India. Focus on choosing the right branch and college. If you're
			interested in specific courses, check out our guide on <a
