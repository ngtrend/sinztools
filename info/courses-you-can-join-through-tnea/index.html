		<h1>Courses You Can Join Through TNEA</h1>
		<p>This guide explains the engineering and technology courses available through Tamil Nadu Engineering
			Admissions (TNEA) counselling. It helps students understand their options after Class 12.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>TNEA is the official counselling process for engineering admissions in Tamil Nadu. Choosing the right course
			is important as it affects your studies and future career path. This guide lists common courses without
			making recommendations.</p>

		<h2>Core engineering courses offered through TNEA</h2>
		<p>Core engineering courses focus on traditional engineering disciplines. Civil Engineering deals with
			construction and infrastructure. Mechanical Engineering covers machines and manufacturing. Electrical and
			Electronics Engineering focuses on electrical systems and electronics. Electronics and Communication
			Engineering combines electronics with communication technologies. Computer Science and Engineering
			emphasizes software and computing.</p>

		<h2>Technology and interdisciplinary courses</h2>
		<p>Technology courses integrate engineering with modern computing. Information Technology focuses on IT systems
			and applications. Artificial Intelligence & Data Science combines AI with data analysis. Computer Science
			specializations include areas like cybersecurity or software engineering. Mechatronics Engineering merges
			mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering.</p>

		<h2>Science and applied engineering courses</h2>
		<p>These courses apply engineering principles to scientific processes. Chemical Engineering involves chemical
			processes and industries. Industrial Engineering focuses on optimizing manufacturing systems. Production
			Engineering deals with manufacturing techniques. Metallurgical Engineering covers metals and materials.
			Availability of these courses depends on the college.</p>

		<h2>Differences between BE and BTech courses</h2>
		<p>BE (Bachelor of Engineering) and BTech (Bachelor of Technology) are similar four-year programs. BE often
			emphasizes theoretical concepts, while BTech focuses more on practical applications. The difference is
			usually in curriculum approach rather than content. For a detailed comparison, read our <a
				href="/info/be-vs-btech">B.E vs B.Tech guide</a>.</p>

		<h2>How course availability varies by college</h2>
		<p>Not all engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu offer every course. Government colleges may have limited branches,
			while larger private colleges offer more options. Course availability depends on the college's
			infrastructure and faculty.</p>

		<h2>How cutoff marks affect course selection</h2>
		<p>Higher cutoff marks give access to popular courses and colleges. Lower marks may limit options to less
			competitive branches. Use our <a href="/tools/tamil-nadu-engineering-cutoff-calculator/">Tamil Nadu
				Engineering Cutoff Calculator</a> to understand how your marks relate to course choices.</p>

		<h2>Things to consider before choosing a course</h2>
		<p>Consider your interest in mathematics, physics, and related subjects. Think about your academic strengths and
			preferred learning style. Reflect on your long-term study goals and career interests. Check if the course is
			available at colleges you're interested in.</p>
