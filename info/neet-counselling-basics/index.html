		<h1>NEET Counselling Basics – Complete Beginner Guide</h1>
		<p>This guide explains NEET counselling in simple terms. It covers how the process works, different types of
			counselling, eligible courses, and common mistakes to avoid. This information helps you prepare for medical
			admissions in India.</p>

		<h2>What is NEET Counselling?</h2>
		<p>NEET counselling is the process that happens after you take the NEET exam. It helps allocate seats in medical
			and dental colleges based on your exam score. Counselling is required because there are more students than
			available seats. Anyone who qualifies NEET and wants to join MBBS, BDS, or other medical courses needs to
			attend counselling.</p>

		<h2>Who Conducts NEET Counselling?</h2>
		<p>NEET counselling is managed by different authorities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>All India Quota (AIQ)</strong> – Handled by the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC). This is for
				15% of seats across India.</li>
			<li><strong>State Quota Counselling</strong> – Managed by each state's health department or medical
				education board. This covers 85% of seats in state colleges.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The main difference is that AIQ counselling is centralized and open to all, while state counselling focuses
			on seats within that state.</p>

		<h2>Types of NEET Counselling</h2>
		<p>There are several types of counselling based on seat categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>All India Quota (15%)</strong> – Seats reserved for students from any state, allocated through
				MCC.</li>
			<li><strong>State Quota (85%)</strong> – Most seats are under state counselling, where preference is given
				to state residents.</li>
			<li><strong>Deemed University counselling</strong> – For private deemed universities, often through MCC or
				state authorities.</li>
			<li><strong>Private medical college counselling</strong> – Managed by state governments for self-financing
				colleges.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Courses Covered Under NEET Counselling</h2>
		<p>NEET counselling covers various medical and allied health courses:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>MBBS</strong> – Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, the main medical degree.</li>
			<li><strong>BDS</strong> – Bachelor of Dental Surgery, for dentistry.</li>
			<li><strong>BAMS</strong> – Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery, traditional medicine.</li>
			<li><strong>BHMS</strong> – Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery, homeopathy.</li>
			<li><strong>BUMS</strong> – Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery, Unani medicine.</li>
			<li><strong>BVSc & AH</strong> – Bachelor of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, for veterinary
				medicine.</li>
			<li><strong>B.Pharm / Pharm.D</strong> – Pharmacy courses, available in some states through NEET
				counselling.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Step-by-Step NEET Counselling Process</h2>
		<p>The counselling process follows these steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Registration</strong> – Create an account on the counselling portal and pay the fee.</li>
			<li><strong>Choice filling</strong> – Select preferred colleges and courses in order of preference.</li>
			<li><strong>Seat allotment</strong> – Based on your rank, choices, and availability, seats are allocated.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Result publication</strong> – Check if you got a seat and accept or reject it.</li>
			<li><strong>Reporting to college</strong> – Visit the allotted college with documents to complete admission.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Upgradation / next rounds</strong> – If seats are available, you can participate in additional
				rounds for better options.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>NEET Cutoff & Rank Role in Counselling</h2>
		<p>Cutoff is the minimum score needed to get a seat. It changes yearly based on exam difficulty and number of
			applicants. Your rank is calculated from your percentile – higher percentile means better rank. Different
			categories (General, OBC, SC/ST) have different cutoffs, affecting your seat chances.</p>

		<h2>Government vs Private Medical Colleges</h2>
		<p>Government colleges have lower fees but fewer seats and higher competition. Private colleges charge more but
			offer more seats. Both have bond rules requiring service in rural areas after graduation. Government
			colleges are preferred for affordability, while private ones provide more options.</p>

		<h2>Common Mistakes Students Make During NEET Counselling</h2>
		<p>Avoid these errors:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Missing registration deadline</strong> – Counselling has strict timelines; missing them means
				losing seats.</li>
			<li><strong>Filling fewer choices</strong> – Include many options to increase chances of getting a seat.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Ignoring state counselling</strong> – Many seats are in state quota; don't skip it.</li>
			<li><strong>Confusing AIQ with state quota</strong> – Understand the difference to make informed choices.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Important Points Parents Should Know</h2>
		<p>Parents should be aware of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Fee transparency</strong> – Check official fee structures to avoid surprises.</li>
			<li><strong>Bond/service rules</strong> – Many colleges require rural service after MBBS.</li>
			<li><strong>Hostel & living costs</strong> – Additional expenses beyond tuition fees.</li>
			<li><strong>Document verification importance</strong> – Bring all required documents to avoid admission
				issues.</li>
		</ul>
