		<h1>How Medical College Fees Work in Tamil Nadu</h1>
		<p>This guide explains how medical college fees are structured in Tamil Nadu. It helps students and parents
			understand the different types of colleges and factors that affect fees.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Understanding medical college fees is important for students planning to pursue MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, or allied
			medical courses in Tamil Nadu. Fees can vary significantly based on the college type and other factors. This
			guide provides a general overview without specific numbers.</p>

		<h2>Types of medical colleges in Tamil Nadu</h2>
		<p>Medical colleges in Tamil Nadu fall into four main categories. Government medical colleges are run by the
			state government and offer the lowest fees. Government aided colleges receive some government funding but
			charge higher fees. Private medical colleges are managed by private organizations and have higher fee
			structures. Deemed universities are private institutions with university status and typically have the
			highest fees.</p>

		<h2>How fees differ by college type</h2>
		<p>Government colleges have fees controlled by the state government, making them more affordable. Private and
			deemed colleges have more autonomy in setting fees, which leads to higher costs. The counselling authority,
			like the Directorate of Medical Education, may regulate fees for government quota seats but has less control
			over management quota fees.</p>

		<h2>Course-wise fee differences</h2>
		<p>MBBS courses generally have higher fees due to the duration and resources required. BDS courses for dental
			studies have similar fee ranges to MBBS. AYUSH courses like BAMS, BHMS, and BUMS focus on alternative
			medicine and often have lower fees. Allied medical courses such as nursing or physiotherapy typically have
			the lowest fee ranges among medical programs.</p>

		<h2>Additional costs students should consider</h2>
		<p>Beyond tuition fees, students should budget for hostel and mess fees if living on campus. Exam fees,
			university registration fees, and other administrative costs add up. Books, laboratory equipment, clinical
			training materials, and transportation can also increase expenses.</p>

		<h2>Why exact medical college fees are hard to predict</h2>
		<p>Fees can change annually due to inflation, policy updates, and college decisions. Different admission quotas
			(government, management, NRI) may have varying fees. Counselling rules and government regulations can affect
			fee structures. Each college has some autonomy in setting additional charges.</p>

			additional costs beyond tuition.</p>
