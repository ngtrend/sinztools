		<h1>Pharmacy College Fee Estimation Guide (Tamil Nadu)</h1>
		<p>This guide helps you understand how pharmacy college fees work in Tamil Nadu. It explains the different
			courses, fee structures, and how to estimate costs before counselling. This information is for planning
			purposes only.</p>

		<h2>What is Pharmacy Counselling?</h2>
		<p>Pharmacy counselling is the process where students get admitted to pharmacy courses based on their entrance
			exam scores. In Tamil Nadu, this is conducted by the Directorate of Medical Education (DME) for government
			colleges and through private counselling for self-financing colleges. Courses covered include Diploma in
			Pharmacy (D.Pharm), Bachelor of Pharmacy (B.Pharm), and Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D).</p>

		<h2>Pharmacy Courses and Duration</h2>
		<p>Pharmacy offers different courses with varying durations and career paths:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>D.Pharm</strong> – A 2-year diploma course. Offered by many government and private colleges.
				Focuses on basic pharmacy skills and leads to roles like pharmacy assistant or further studies.</li>
			<li><strong>B.Pharm</strong> – A 4-year bachelor's degree. Available in most pharmacy colleges. Provides a
				strong foundation for careers in pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, or research.</li>
			<li><strong>Pharm.D</strong> – A 6-year clinical pharmacy program. More advanced and includes hospital
				training. Ideal for clinical roles but requires higher fees due to extended duration.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How Pharmacy College Fees Are Structured</h2>
		<p>Pharmacy college fees include several components:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Tuition fees</strong> – The main course fee charged annually or per semester.</li>
			<li><strong>Special fees</strong> – For labs, libraries, or extracurricular activities.</li>
			<li><strong>Hostel & mess fees</strong> – If staying on campus, these add to the total cost.</li>
			<li><strong>Exam & university fees</strong> – For examinations and university affiliations.</li>
			<li><strong>One-time admission charges</strong> – Paid once at the start, including registration and
				security deposits.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Total fees can range widely based on the college and course.</p>

		<h2>Government vs Private Pharmacy College Fees</h2>
		<p>Fees differ significantly by college type:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Government colleges</strong> – Low tuition fees (often under ₹10,000-20,000 per year), limited
				seats, merit-based admission.</li>
			<li><strong>Private colleges</strong> – Higher fees (₹50,000-2,00,000 per year), more seats, includes
				management quota.</li>
			<li><strong>Deemed universities</strong> – Highest fees (₹2,00,000+ per year), premium facilities but
				expensive.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>D.Pharm is generally cheaper than B.Pharm, and Pharm.D is the most expensive due to its length.</p>

		<h2>How to Estimate Pharmacy Fees Before Counselling</h2>
		<p>Follow these steps to estimate fees:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Identify the course</strong> – Choose D.Pharm, B.Pharm, or Pharm.D based on your goals.</li>
			<li><strong>Identify college type</strong> – Decide between government, private, or deemed university.</li>
			<li><strong>Check previous year fee ranges</strong> – Look at official counselling notifications or college
				websites for last year's fees.</li>
			<li><strong>Add hostel and misc expenses</strong> – Include ₹20,000-50,000 per year for accommodation and
				other costs.</li>
			<li><strong>Keep a buffer for annual hikes</strong> – Fees may increase 5-10% each year, so plan for that.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Why Pharmacy Fees Vary Each Year</h2>
		<p>Fees change due to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Counselling authority changes</strong> – Updates in fee regulations by DME or other bodies.</li>
			<li><strong>Seat type</strong> – Government seats are cheaper than management quota seats.</li>
			<li><strong>Category & quota</strong> – Reserved categories may have fee concessions.</li>
			<li><strong>University regulations</strong> – Affiliated universities set minimum fee standards.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Common Mistakes Students Make</h2>
		<p>Avoid these errors when estimating fees:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Ignoring hostel fees</strong> – Many students forget accommodation costs, which can double
				expenses.</li>
			<li><strong>Confusing tuition with total fees</strong> – Tuition is only part of the total; add all
				components.</li>
			<li><strong>Assuming all colleges charge the same</strong> – Fees vary widely, so research each college.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>Pharmacy college fees vary by college, quota, counselling authority, and academic year. This guide is for
			estimation purposes only. Always verify fees from official counselling notifications or college prospectus.
