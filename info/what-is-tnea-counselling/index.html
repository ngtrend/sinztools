		<h1>What is TNEA Counselling?</h1>
		<p>This guide explains Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) counselling in simple terms. It covers the
			basics to help students and parents understand the process.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to TNEA Counselling</h2>
		<p>TNEA stands for Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions. It is the official counselling process for admission to
			engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu. The counselling helps students get seats in government and private
			engineering colleges based on their marks and preferences.</p>

		<h2>Who conducts TNEA counselling?</h2>
		<p>TNEA counselling is conducted by the Directorate of Technical Education (DoTE), Tamil Nadu. This is a
			government body that manages technical education in the state. They organize the counselling every year
			after the Class 12 board exams.</p>

		<h2>Who is eligible for TNEA counselling?</h2>
		<p>Students who have passed Class 12 with Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry as main subjects are eligible. You
			need to have appeared for the Tamil Nadu State Board exams or equivalent. There are minimum mark
			requirements, and reservation rules apply for different categories.</p>

		<h2>How is engineering cutoff calculated in TNEA?</h2>
		<p>The engineering cutoff is calculated using marks from Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. The formula
			combines these subjects with specific weights. For example, Mathematics is often weighted higher. You can
			use our <a href="/tools/tamil-nadu-engineering-cutoff-calculator/">Tamil Nadu Engineering Cutoff
				Calculator</a> to estimate your cutoff based on your marks.</p>

		<h2>What courses are offered through TNEA?</h2>
		<p>TNEA offers admission to Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Technology (BTech) courses. These
			include branches like Computer Science, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and many others in government and
			private colleges across Tamil Nadu.</p>

		<h2>Step-by-step TNEA counselling process</h2>
		<p>The counselling process has several steps. First, register online with your details and marks. Then, a rank
			list is published based on your cutoff. Next, attend counselling rounds to choose colleges and courses.
			Finally, seats are allotted based on your rank and availability.</p>

		<h2>Important notes for students</h2>
		<p>Keep all your documents ready, like mark sheets and certificates. Check deadlines carefully and apply on
			time. Do not make mistakes in your application, as it can affect your admission. Stay updated with official
			announcements from DoTE.</p>
