	<h1>About SinzTools</h1>
	<p>SinzTools is a collection of free, browser-based tools designed to help users with images, files, and
		everyday utilities quickly and easily.</p>
	<p>Most tools run entirely in your web browser, meaning your files never leave your device. There's no need to
		upload files to any server for these tools, ensuring complete privacy and security.</p>
	<p>Our privacy-first approach means we don't collect, store, or share any personal data or files at this
		stage. SinzTools is
		built for everyday users who need simple, reliable utilities without complications.</p>
	<p>In the future, we may add tools that require limited server-side processing, which will be clearly disclosed
		and
		explained.</p>
