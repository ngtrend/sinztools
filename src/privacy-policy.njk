<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>At SinzTools, your privacy is our top priority. We are committed to being transparent about how we handle
	data.
</p>
<h2>No File Uploads</h2>
<p>Most of our current tools do not require uploading files to any server. All processing for these tools
	happens directly in your web
	browser on your device.</p>
<h2>No File Storage</h2>
<p>For current tools, we do not store, save, or retain any of your files. Once you close your browser or
	navigate away, no traces
	remain on our servers.</p>
<h2>Analytics & Privacy</h2>
<p>SinzTools uses privacy-friendly analytics provided by Cloudflare to understand general site usage.
	These analytics do not use cookies, do not track users across websites, and do not collect personally
	identifiable information.</p>
<h2>Future Changes</h2>
<p>In the future, we may add basic analytics or advertising to support the site, or introduce tools that require
	server-side processing. Any such changes will be optional, clearly disclosed, and this policy will be
	updated
	accordingly.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>We believe tools should respect your privacy by default.</p>
